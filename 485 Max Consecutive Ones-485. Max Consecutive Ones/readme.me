Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.  

Example 1:  
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]  
Output: 3  
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.  
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.  
    
Note:  

The input array will only contain 0 and 1.  
The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000  


else{
     if(count > max_count)  
     max_count = count;    
     count = 0;  
    }

put "max_count = count" in the "else" can save some computation. However, don't forget to judge after the "for" loopï¼Œ for the condition that the last number is 1.
